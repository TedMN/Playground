/**
 * Provides a month view window for a given month and year.  Returns the 42 cells for a 7 by 6 calendar. 
 * Thursday, September 14, 1752 and newer; still works for older dates.  Aligns with JavaScript fairly far back.
 * Call calendarUtil.monthWindow(2044,01) -- Returns the 42 cells for the 2044 January calendar view/window.
